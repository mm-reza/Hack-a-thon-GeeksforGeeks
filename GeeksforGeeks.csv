GeeksforGeeks,Bi-Wizard School Coding Contest | GeeksforGeeks School,2556,88,GeeksforGeeks,"Coding is the most in-demand and upcoming skill of the industry and it will continue to grow as the years pass. Despite all this, students often restrict themselves from getting started with coding, and not only students, but the parents are also not very much active in encouraging their wards to learn to code.  

And we believe now is the time to break this stigma around this conversation and to promote coding culture among students and create genuine interest & curiosity in them to get started with coding. Keeping this in mind, GeeksforGeeks is coming up with an exciting coding tournament exclusively for school students!

And if you know any sibling/acquaintance who is a high school student and has a flair for learning and coding, don't let them miss this opportunity!

Starting to learn any activity from a young age has its advantages- you develop learning habits at a young age, and it helps students get a cut above the rest and become a role model. So if students are pushed into sports and other activities from a young age, why is there still a stigma around the world of coding?

Meet Pratham Prasoon, a 17 year ML enthusiast who is one of the many students of the country who are helping break this stigma one day at a time. And also, his 78K+ Twitter followers are always motivated seeing his work: https://twitter.com/PrasoonPratham

GeeksforGeeks,Tips For System Design Interview | Yogita Sharma | GeeksforGeeks,2484,105,system design interview preparation,"You need to know that System Design Interviews are not like Coding Interviews where there are one or two definite solutions for the given problem - instead System Design Interviews are the subjective ones and there can be so many solutions for a particular problem depending on how you approach the problem, how you'll apply your knowledge to actually build a system, etc. And this is why cracking System Design interviews is not an easy-to-go task. 

But, to make things a bit easier for you, here we have an expert Yogita Sharma with us who is currently working as an SDE II at Careem (Uber) - she will tell you some most worthwhile and effective tips that will surely help you to ace in your upcoming System Design Interviews. 

00:00 Let's Start
01:10 Try to Follow an Organized Approach
03:06 Mention the Advantages & Disadvantages of Your Approach
04:36 Don't Use Complicated Terms/Jargons That You Don't Know
05:08 Share the Extended Features
05:30 Discuss the Different Properties of the System

GeeksforGeeks,Handling Missing Values in Pandas Dataframe | GeeksforGeeks,68831,1535,GeeksforGeeks,"In this video, we're going to discuss how to handle missing values in Pandas. In Pandas DataFrame sometimes many datasets simply arrive with missing data, either because it exists and was not collected or it never existed.

01:44 Checking for Missing Values using isnull()
03:31 Filling Null Values Using fillna()
05:35 Filling Null Values Using fillna(method = 'pad')
07:05 Filling Null Values Using fillna(method = 'bfill')
11:41 Filling Null Values with the Mean, Max or Min of a Column
13:38 Dropping Null Values Using dropna()

18:47 Filling Null Values Using interpolate()
